i think the game is about go closer
and handle 8 side of a player , make the best move if an enemy prisent in one of your sides


[0][0][P][0]
[0][0][E][0]
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][p][0]
[0][0][0][0]

in this case make best move to top

[0][P][0][0]
[P][E][0][0]
[0][0][p][0]
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][0][0]

in this case make second best move to left or top


[0][P][0][0]
[0][E][p][0]
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][0][0]


in this case move to best position bottom


[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][E][0]
[0][0][p][0]
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][0][0]

in this case just stay in your position and announce an attack


[0][0][0][0]
[0][E][P][0]
[0][0][p][0]
[0][0][0][0]
[0][0][0][0]

in this case player move left

othersiwe just go closer to selected enemy team
----------------------------
record and fix bugs 
fix bug player jump
check if team two players from the same team surround enemy from two sides not opposite to each other , only one should not move

fix that
if (move == 0 && ft_find_path_to_position(player))      
{
        //problem here is when player block and find path to go out and next move can bring him back to same position and block again 
        //so either remove it or save last position when find path do job and if she brings you back skip it 
        //or just always give to find path last position to not calcule path and return to it 
        move = ft_move_to_position_path(player);//make move
        printf("Find path [%d]\n", move);
}*/
